"# Django" 


For this project you'll need to create a virtual environment with anaconda:

```

1. conda create --name Django

2. conda activate Django

>Steps 3 to 5 are only necessary the first time creating the environment

3. conda install Django

4. conda install mysqlclient

5. conda install -c conda-forge djangorestframework 

```

Once the your virtual environement is set, go to the project's folder of your choice and launch the project:

```

python manage.py runserver

```

Enjoy !
